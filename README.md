Core Java concepts for Test automation engineer

## What, Why, and How of Java
- Who developed Java? - Sun Microsystems. James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team. The team's goal was to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. But it was suited for the internet. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later, it was renamed Java.
- What is the main reason for Java's popularity? - Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language that is easy to use and learn. Java is object-oriented, platform-independent, and secure. Java is robust and secure because it uses strong memory management. Java is multithreaded, making it possible to write programs that can do many things simultaneously. Java is portable, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any computer with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java is a general-purpose language, meaning that it can be used to create any type of program, from desktop applications to web applications to mobile applications. Java is also a high-level language, meaning that it is easy to read and write, and it is easy to learn.
- What is the JVM? - The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software program that runs on a computer and interprets Java bytecode. Java bytecode is the machine language of the JVM. Java bytecode is generated by the Java compiler when you compile a Java program. The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program. The JVM is available for many different operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. This means that you can write a Java program on one computer and run it on another computer with a different operating system without having to recompile the program.
- What is Java bytecode? - Java bytecode is the machine language of the JVM. Java bytecode is generated by the Java compiler when you compile a Java program. The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes the program.
- What is the main reason for Java's security? - Java is a secure language, meaning that it is difficult to write programs that can harm your computer. Java programs run inside the JVM, which provides a secure environment for the programs to run in. The JVM checks the bytecode for security violations before executing the program. This makes it difficult for malicious programs to harm your computer. Java also has a built-in security manager that can be used to restrict the actions that a program can perform. This makes it possible to run untrusted programs in a secure environment.
- What is the main reason for Java's robustness? - Java is a robust language, meaning that it is difficult to write programs that crash your computer. Java has strong memory management, which means that it is difficult to write programs that use too much memory or that access memory that is not allocated to them. Java also has strong exception handling, which means that it is difficult to write programs that crash your computer. Java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used. This makes it easy to write programs that do not have memory leaks.
- What is the main reason for Java's multithreading? - Java is a multithreaded language, meaning that it is possible to write programs that can do many things simultaneously. Java has built-in support for multithreading, which makes it easy to write programs that can take advantage of multiple processors. This makes it possible to write programs that can do many things at once, such as downloading a file while displaying a progress bar. Java also has built-in support for synchronization, which makes it easy to write programs that can share data between threads. This makes it possible to write programs that can do many things at once without corrupting the data.
- What is the main reason for Java's portability? - Java is a portable language, meaning that it can run on any computer with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
